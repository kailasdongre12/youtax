            Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is an alternate hybrid corporate business form,
            designed to provide limited liabilities to partners while offering the flexibility
            of a partnership. It combines the benefits of limited liability like a company with
            the operational flexibility of a partnership.

            The LLP Act of 2008 governs LLPs in India. This structure has proven to be more
            flexible and efficient for entrepreneurs and professionals, allowing them to
            create partnership structures tailored to their needs.

            Once incorporated, an LLP becomes a separate legal entity with the rights to sue
            or be sued, sign contracts, and own property in its own name. It is cheaper and
            easier to operate than a private limited company due to fewer compliance
            requirements.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            Unless otherwise agreed in a formal LLP agreement, LLPs are governed by

            An LLP agreement must be filed within 30 days of incorporation with the Ministry
            of Corporate Affairs. It defines the rights and duties of the partners towards
            each other and the LLP, covering changes in partner roles, addition or removal
            of partners, and ensuring smooth functioning of the business.
            Without such an agreement, the LLP will be governed by Schedule One of the LLP Act.

      The incorporation of an LLP basically means registering it with the Ministry of
      Corporate Affairs (MCA). The process is simple yet can be time-consuming and tricky.
      A minimum of two partners are required to incorporate an LLP, and at least one partner
      must be a citizen of India. If an LLP agreement is made, the rights and duties of the
      partners are determined by it. The LLP agreement is directly responsible for compliance
      with all provisions of the LLP Act, 2009.
