             Every Company and LLP registered under the Companies Act, 2013 and Limited Liability 
             Partnership Act, 2008 has to mandatorily file an annual declaration to the Registrar of 
             Companies of the state in which the Company or LLP is instituted. ROC compliances 
             can be made once a year or on the happening of an event. Registrar of Company is a 
             body governed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) that looks after the 
             administration of companies and LLP. It is also responsible to issue certification of 
             incorporation or registration and take cognizance of every new development in 
             the affairs of the companies and LLP. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            In any ROC compliance, the company or LLP has to inform the ROC about every change that 
            takes place within the company or LLP like a change in the directors, change in name, or 
            association. The ROC compliance must include the annual returns, agreements, and other 
            financial details. Also, the company and LLP have to file various forms with the ROC 
            compliances which are related to a specific purpose like the passing of any new resolution or 
            appointment of a director.
